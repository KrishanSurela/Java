## What are Strings ?

### In Java, a string is a sequence of characters that can be stored as an object of the String class. Strings are immutable, which means they cannot be changed once created. 
### Strings can be created in two ways: 

- by using string literals or 
- by using the new keyword.

### Strings can be manipulated using various methods provided by the String class, such as length(), concat(), equals(), substring(), etc. Strings can also be compared using the == operator or the equals() method

### jab bhi hm Strings me changes krne ki try krenge har baar hmare paas naya object bnke aayega. Heap memory jyada fill hogi har bar string ke ander chhote chhote changes krne se code inefficient ho jayega aur code slow run hoga.

### Jab bhi hme Strings me changes krne ki jarurat pdegi hm StringBuilder ko use krenge.
